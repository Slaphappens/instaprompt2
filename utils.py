Create 3 creative and engaging social media captions designed for maximum reach and exposure.

Platform: {platform}
Topic: {topic}

- Include emojis to increase engagement
- Include powerful, **popular and relevant hashtags** for maximum discoverability
- No introductions or explanations, just the 3 captions
- Adapt style and tone to platform and topic:
  ‚Ä¢ Fitness = motivational and energetic
